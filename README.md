# Smart-Data-Analyzer 

*COMPANY*: SNESTRON SYSTEMS PRIVATE LIMITED

*DOMAIN*: PYTHON PROGRAMMING 

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: KAMMAMPATI SATISH

## The Smart Data Analyzer using Python is a beginner-friendly, real-world Python project developed as part of the Snestron Python Programming Internship. This project is designed to give interns practical experience working with real-world data, using core Python libraries and concepts, while also enabling them to showcase their ability to build a fully functional data analysis tool from scratch.

The primary goal of this project is to allow users to upload any CSV file and instantly receive useful insights about the data, including basic statistics, summary reports, and visualizations. This simulates the common real-world task of performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in data science and analytics projects.

üß† Project Objective
The Smart Data Analyzer aims to automate the early stages of data exploration. When data analysts or data scientists start working on a new dataset, the first step is to understand the structure of the data ‚Äî such as the number of rows and columns, missing values, data types, and statistical summaries. Doing all this manually for each dataset can be repetitive and time-consuming. This project solves that problem by providing a smart and automated solution using Python.

The tool:

Accepts any .csv file as input

Displays basic information about the dataset

Generates a clean .txt summary report

Creates useful visualizations of numerical columns

Saves all outputs in an organized structure

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
The project is built using:

Python 3.8+ ‚Äì Core programming language

Pandas ‚Äì For loading, exploring, and analyzing datasets

Matplotlib ‚Äì For generating visualizations

Seaborn ‚Äì For creating attractive plots with KDE (Kernel Density Estimation)

VS Code ‚Äì As the development environment

GitHub ‚Äì For hosting and submitting the final project

These tools are some of the most commonly used in the data science industry, making this project highly relevant for students and aspiring professionals.

üìÅ Project Structure
The folder contains:

main.py: The main Python script that performs all analysis and visualizations.

sample_dataset.csv: A sample CSV file to test the program.

analysis_report.txt: A text file auto-generated after running the script, containing dataset insights.

screenshots/: A folder containing screenshots of the terminal output and generated graphs (used as proof for internship submission).

README.md: Project description and instructions for running the tool.

üìù Features
The Smart Data Analyzer comes with several features:

1. Automatic Data Loading
The user is prompted to input the name of a CSV file. The program then loads this dataset using Pandas and prepares it for analysis.

2. Basic Information Display
The tool prints:

Number of rows and columns

Column names and data types

First five rows of the dataset

Total missing values in each column

3. Text Report Generation
A file named analysis_report.txt is automatically generated, which includes:

Dataset shape and column names

Statistical summaries (mean, standard deviation, min, max, etc.)

Missing values count per column

4. Visual Analysis
For each numeric column (e.g., Age, Salary), the program creates:

A histogram with a smooth KDE curve

Saves the chart as an image (e.g., Age_distribution.png) inside the /screenshots folder

These charts help users visualize how the data is distributed ‚Äî an essential step in data-driven decision-making.

üîÅ Workflow Summary
Run the program using python main.py

Provide the name of a CSV file (e.g., sample_dataset.csv)

The program:

Analyzes the data

Generates a text report

Saves visualizations in a folder

Take screenshots of:

The terminal output

One of the graphs

GitHub repo

Upload the project to GitHub and submit the link for internship review

üéØ Learning Outcomes
Through this project, interns learn how to:

Work with real-world datasets

Use core Python libraries for data analysis

Generate automated reports

Create and save visualizations

Structure a professional project

Use Git and GitHub for version control and submission

This gives a hands-on foundation in Python data analysis and prepares interns for more advanced topics like machine learning, automation, and dashboard building.
